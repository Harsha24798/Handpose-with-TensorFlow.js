# Handpose Detection App with TensorFlow.js

This project demonstrates the use of **TensorFlow.js** to detect hand landmarks in real-time using the pre-trained **Handpose** model. The model estimates 21 3D hand landmarks from a video stream, which you can use for hand gesture recognition or other applications.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Landmark Detection**: The app uses TensorFlow.js to estimate 21 landmarks per hand.
- **Webcam Integration**: Captures video from the user's webcam to run the handpose model.
- **Interactive Visualization**: You can visualize the hand landmarks (this can be extended with visualizations such as drawing lines or points for each landmark).
